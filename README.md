## Contributing
We welcome any contributions you might have. Please follow our formatting for Dockerfiles, which involves minimizing the number of layers, as well as the size of the container. If possible, please stick to Alpine Linux based images, however we do make use of `ubuntu:18.04` in the [`source` branch](https://github.com/parkervcp/images/tree/source) due to Source Engine limitations, and reducing the conflicts that might arise.
